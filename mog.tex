\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
\noindent It is notoriously difficult to understand the charge of falling prey to the Myth of the Given. The principal obstacle was erected by Sellars himself. The Myth of the Given is said to arise in various forms, and yet each of these forms participates in a framework of givenness---a framework that Sellars declines to specify in general terms. As interpreters of Sellars, we may speculate about how best to understand the general framework of givenness. It is reasonable to attempt to reconstruct that framework in light of Sellars' discussion of the more specific forms of the Myth and especially in light of the conceptual genealogies he offers. However, there is no consensus on how the Myth of the Given is to be understood in general terms even among philosophers sympathetic with Sellars on fundamental issues. Thus different accounts of the Myth are given by \citet{Brandom:2002fk}, \citet{Coates:2007ly}, \citet{deVries:2005qf}, \citet{McDowell:1996uq,McDowell:1998vn}, \citet{Rosenberg:2007ve}, \citet{Rorty:1979ys}, and \citet{Williams:1977zr}.

One can know, or at least reasonably judge, that a conception of perception is a form of the Myth of the Given (if it is indeed a myth) without knowing in general terms what the Myth of the Given is. So, for example, I am increasingly attracted to a conception of visual perception where vision affords the perceiver with a sensory mode of awareness of particulars spatially distant from the perceiver's body. This distinctive sensory mode of awareness is non-propositional---\-it doesn't take a fact as its object, but a particular. Moreover this sensory mode of awareness is fundamental and irreducible. This fundamental and irreducible sensory mode of awareness of spatiotemporal particulars arrayed in a mind-independent environment makes one knowledgeable of that environment. In being so aware of a particular, the perceiver is in a position to know certain things about it, depending, of course, on the perceiver's possession and exercise of recognitional capacities appropriate to the given circumstances. We can be confident that Sellars, at least, would regard this as a form of the Myth of the Given since it involves a pre-conceptual mode of awareness. % that makes propositional knowledge available to the perceiving subject, whether or not such knowledge is in fact activated (in Williamson's \citeyear{Williamson:1990uq} terminology.) 

Suppose, then, one is liable to the charge of falling prey to the Myth of the Given. How might one respond to the charge? Not directly, it seems. For suppose one could argue that the Myth of the Given was no myth on a specific understanding of that charge. Given the lack of consensus on how the framework of givenness is to be understood, it would remain an open question whether the conception defended was yet another form of the Myth on a distinct and potentially superior understanding of it. A lack of a definitive statement of the Myth from Sellars and a lack of consensus on how best to reconstruct the general framework of givenness renders the charge elusive and Protean. Being liable to the charge is like being the man from the country who seeks access to the law in Kafka's parable. Denied access to law, should one simply despair before its gatekeepers?

While no direct response is possible, perhaps an \emph{indirect} response is. I can think of two complementary strategies. First, one might strive to satisfy oneself that perception, so conceived, is epistemically significant---that the conception renders intelligible that perception should make one knowledgeable of a mind-independent subject matter. Of course, by itself, this would fail to persuade anyone inclined to prosecute that charge, but persuading the prosecution is unnecessary to achieve the modest task of setting one's own mind at ease about the epistemic significance of perception as one conceives it to be. The task may be modest in this way, but it is an essential first step that promises to clarify what's at issue in the dispute. Second, one might examine rival conceptions of perception that are tailor-made to avoid the Myth of the Given such as those provided by \citet{Sellars:1956xp} and \citet{McDowell:1996uq,McDowell:1998vn,McDowell:2008fk}. If criticism of conceptions designed specifically to avoid the Myth naturally motivates a conception that is known, or reasonably judged, to be a form of the Myth, this is some reason, at least, to think that Myth of the Given is no myth. 

These, then, are the strategies that I will be pursuing. In the first part, I proceed dogmatically, sketching how visual perception, conceived as a non-propositional sensory mode of awareness, can make the subject knowledgeable of particulars without the mind. Doing so will clarify at least one aspect of the issue in dispute---one source of disagreement about the epistemic significance of perception, so conceived, turns on a disagreement about the metaphysics of reasons. In the second part, I proceed dialectically, discussing Sellars and McDowell on perceptual experience. Of particular interest will be McDowell's criticism that Sellars misconceives the nature of sensibility by allowing receptivity to operate independently of the subject's conceptual capacities. There are distinguishable claims made in the course of leveling this criticism. Marking these allows us to see that McDowell is right in rejecting Sellars' account, but wrong in thinking that this requires our conceptual capacities to be operative in perceptual awareness. % This involves thinking of the awareness of spatially distant particulars that vision affords the perceiver as pre-conceptual---as a form of the Myth. But if it is, the Myth is no myth. Or so I will argue.

\section{Sensory Awareness} % (fold)
\label{sec:sensory_awareness}

Dissatisfaction with the quality of tomatoes available in central London and not a concern for the veracity of philosophical clichès was my reason for growing tomatoes by my window. It is a large plant in a terra cotta pot that sits on a wooden stool set against a generous Victorian window. In the background is a field of rubble where Middlesex Hospital used to be. Everything has been leveled except for the chapel. Looking up I see a ripening tomato set against this complex scene. It is not quite ripe---it is a yellowish red, if not orange. Moreover, it is dappled in sunlight that has just emerged from the clouds in the aftermath of a shower. When I see the ripening tomato, the ripening tomato is the object of my perceptual experience---I am aware of the tomato in my perceptual experience of it. 

The awareness involved in my visual perception is \emph{sensory} in the way that the awareness of a passing thought in the stream of consciousness is not. Moreover, vision affords the subject with a distinctive \emph{mode} of sensory awareness. Vision is not alone among the senses in providing information about the distal environment. Thus we can \emph{see} the leaves rustling and \emph{hear} them rustling. Perhaps, as \citet[]{Berkeley:1734fk} urged, we hear, at least in the first instance, the sound of the rustling leaves. But, if we do, then, at least in propitious circumstances, we hear the source of the sound by hearing the sound. So whereas vision affords the subject with a \emph{visual} mode of awareness of the event, arguably at least, audition affords the subject with an \emph{auditory} mode of awareness of the very same event. (For recent discussion of audition see Nudds and O'Callaghan \citeyear{Nudds:2009sk}).

The objects of visual awareness are spatiotemporal particulars arrayed in a mind-independent environment. These particulars do not constitute a unified ontological category. Among them are objects (the plant, the stool), events (the rustling of the leaves, the sun's setting), and property instances (the yellowish red of the tomato). But objects, events, and property instances have distinct modes of being. Thus, for example, events are spatiotemporal particulars that unfold through time in a way that neither objects nor property instances do (though see Sider \citeyear{Sider:1997fk} for criticism of this way of distinguishing events from objects; see also Hawthorne \citeyear{Hawthorne:2008uq} and Fine \citeyear{Fine:2006fk} for further discussion). The particulars that we see also differ in degree of both substantiality and being. In addition to ordinary material substances like tomatoes, we see flashes, flames, reflections, and rainbows, on the one hand, and shadows and holes, on the other hand. Flashes are unusual events. They are colored, but most events are not colored despited having colored participants. (What color was the Battle of Kosovo?) But what is presently important is that they also lack substrata. And the plant's shadow is constituted by a relative decrease in the amount of light uniformly distributed across the visible spectrum in a region determined by the positions of the plant and the light source. But a relative decrease is a privation or diminution of being \citep[see][]{Sorensen:2008kx}. Shadows may be creatures of darkness, but that does not make them candidates for elimination. \citet{Quine:1948ef} may crack wise about the possible fat man in the door way, but perception makes shadows, a species of privation, the subject matter of demonstrative thought and talk. Despite being particulars, the objects of perception differ, in this way, in mode, substantiality, and being. (On the heterogeneity of the objects of visual perception see Austin \citeyear{Austin:1962lr}.) % Moreover, perception makes available demonstrative thoughts about these particulars. Seeing the yellow-red tomato, I recognize it's state of maturation and think---that's not ripe yet. But perception also makes available demonstrative thoughts about flashes---that's red---and holes---that's too big to jump across. 

Vision makes spatially distant particulars visually present. When I see the yellowish red tomato, I see a particular spatially distant from me. Moreover, I experience the yellowish red as inhering in the external surface of that particular. Hering's \citeyearpar[8]{Hering:1920ty} ringed shadow experiment demonstrates the phenomenological difference between a color merely overlaying a surface and that color inhering in that surface. When a shadow is cast on a white surface you see the shadow as ``an incidental darkness that lies on the [surface]''. If now a black line is drawn around the shadow completely obscuring its penumbra, the darkness no longer appears to lie on the surface, but rather appears to inhere in the surface. Only then does the shadowed white surface misleadingly look to be gray. In seeing the yellowish red tomato, I experience the yellowish red as inhering in the external surface of the tomato. Of course, not all colors inhere in substances or their parts. A flash can be blue even though the flash lacks a substrata in which the blue could inhere. But even if the blue of the flash inheres in nothing, I experience the blue in the remote spatiotemporal region of the flash. 

Thus, Broad writes:
\begin{quote}
    In its purely phenomenological aspect \emph{seeing} is ostensibly \emph{saltatory}. It seems to leap the spatial gap between the percipient's body and a remote region of space. Then again, it is ostensibly \emph{prehensive} of the surfaces of distant bodies as coloured and extended, and of external events as colour-occurences \emph{localized} in remote regions of space. \citep[32]{Broad:1965dq}
\end{quote}
Seeing is saltatory in that the objects of visual awareness are spatially remote; seeing is prehensive in that its objects are present in our visual awareness of them. ``Prehensive'' belongs to a primordial family of broadly tactile metaphors for visual awareness that includes ``grasping'', and ``apprehending''. What unites these metaphors is that they are all a mode of taking in, and ``ingestion'' is a natural variant \citep[see][7]{Johnston:2006uq,Price:1932fk}. The tactile nature of these metaphors can mislead, however, if we take too seriously the contact involved in taking in an object. Thus Broad remarks that ``It is a natural, if paradoxical, way of speaking to say that seeing seems to `bring us into \emph{contact} with \emph{remote} objects' and to reveal their shapes and colors''. The air of paradox, however, is removed once we recognize that the sense in which visual awareness brings us into contact with particulars does not conflict with the sense in which these particulars are remote. To be sure, seeing the tomato a meter away does not make the tomato proximate, but that just means that the sense in which the tomato is present in visual awareness is not the same sense as the tomato being spatially present.

% And if the taking in is itself a mode of receiving, we have a connection, here, with the Given. 

The phenomenology of being visually presented with colors inhering in external bodies played a role in Russell's felt exuberance in abandoning idealism:
\begin{quote}
	I felt it, in fact, as a great liberation, as if I had escaped from a hothouse on to a wind-swept headland. I hated the stuffiness involved in supposing that space and time were only in my mind. I liked the starry heavens even better than the moral law, and could not bear Kant’s view that the one I liked best was only a subjective figment. In the first exuberance of liberation, I became a naïve realist and rejoiced in the thought that grass is really green, in spite of the adverse opinions of all philosophers from Locke onwards. \citep[48]{Russell:1959fv}
\end{quote}
What Russell rejoiced in was warrantedly taking external bodies to be the way his perceptual experience presents them to be---as having colors inhering in the opaque surfaces they present. He rejoiced in the greenness of the grass revealed by sight. Compare Melville's earlier revulsion at Locke's metaphysics:
\begin{quote}
	And when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues---every stately or lovely emblazoning---the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea, and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but the charnel-house within \ldots\ \citep[ch. 42]{Melville:1851ms}
\end{quote}
Freed from the adverse opinions of all philosophers from Locke onwards, one need no longer think that Nature paints like a harlot and can once again rejoice in the lovely emblazoning of an English pastoral scene.

Visual perception involves a sensory mode of awareness that takes external particulars as objects. This is a claim about sense perception, not sense experience (understood as the genus of which sense perception is a species). It echoes a conception of perception common among early twentieth century realists. There are, of course, important differences between the present conception and its early twentieth century precursors, just as there were important differences that divided the Cambridge and Oxford realists. Thus, contra the present conception, \citet[]{Russell:1912uq} held that we are acquainted with universals as well as particulars. And \citet[]{Russell:1912uq} and \citet[]{Price:1932fk} held that the distinctive sensory mode of awareness was operative not just in sense perception but in sense experience more generally. They were thus committed to a kind of \emph{experiential monism} (in Snowdon's \citeyear{Snowdon:2008oz} terminology). Specifically, all sense experience was conceived to involve, as part of its nature, a sensory mode of awareness. According to the Cambridge realists, then, even subject to illusion or hallucination, there is something of which one is aware. But with that, they were an application of the argument from illusion, or hallucination, or conflicting appearances away from immaterial sense data and a representative realism that tended, over time, to devolve into a form of phenomenalism. In contrast, the Oxford realists, \citet{Cook-Wilson:1926sf} and early \citet{Prichard:1906gf,Prichard:1909yg}, restricted sensory awareness to perception, thus avoiding experiential monism and its degenerative effects  \citep[see][]{Marion:2000kl,Marion:2000ai,Kalderon:2010fk}. For present purposes, I merely accept what is common to the Oxford and Cambridge realists---that visual perception involves a sensory mode of awareness of external particulars.

Sellars observes that if sensory awareness takes particulars as its object, then it cannot be a form of propositional knowledge:
\begin{quote}
	[W]e may well experience a feeling of surprise on noting that according to sense-datum theorists, it is \emph{particulars} that are sensed. For what is \emph{known}, even in in non-inferential knowledge, is \emph{facts} rather than particulars, items of the form \emph{something's being thus and so} or \emph{something's standing in a certain relation to something else}. It would seem, then, that the sensing of sense contents \emph{cannot} constitute knowledge, inferential \emph{or} non-inferential \ldots\ \citep[§3]{Sellars:1956xp}
\end{quote}
What's known are thoughts, propositions, facts---not particulars. Sellars has not explicitly given us a reason for distinguishing thoughts and particulars in this way. Perhaps he regards the distinction as evident. Prichard, however, gives us a reason, indeed, the right kind of reason. According to Prichard, thoughts have a kind of generality that precludes them from being particulars:
\begin{quote}
	There seems to be no way of distinguishing perception and conception as the apprehension of different realities except as the apprehension of the individual and the universal respectively. Distinguished in this way, the faculty of perception is that in virtue of which we apprehend the individual, and the faculty of conception is that power of reflection in virtue of which a universal is made the explicit object of thought. \citep[]{Prichard:1909yg}
\end{quote}
Prichard's claim about the faculty of conception is what provides a reason for distinguishing thoughts and particulars, and Sellars could accept that reason even if he would reject Prichard's claim about the faculty of perception. (For contemporary discussion of particularity and the content of perception see Brewer \citeyear{Brewer:2008fk}, Martin, \citeyear{Martin:2002jb} Soteriou \citeyear{Soteriou:2000iz,Soteriou:2005fk}, and Travis \citeyear{Travis:2005ys}.)



% Sellars' observation is the basis of the following dilemma:
% \begin{quote}
%     The sense-datum theorist, it would seem, must choose between saying:
%     \begin{enumerate}
%         \item[(a)] It is \emph{particulars} which are sensed. Sensing is not knowing. The existence of sense-data does not \emph{logically} imply the existence of knowledge.
%         \item[(b)] Sensing \emph{is} a form of knowing. It is \emph{facts} rather than \emph{particulars} which are sensed. \citep[§3]{Sellars:1956xp}
%     \end{enumerate}
% \end{quote}
% Notice so far in Sellars' discussion all that is in play of the sense-datum theory is the act--object structure of sensing and the hypothesis that the objects of sensings are particulars. Both claims can and have been endorsed by philosophers who are not themselves sense-datum theorists---including naïve realists, disjunctivists, and advocates of the theory of appearing. So Sellars' dilemma for the sense-datum theorist is applicable to other positions as well, including the present conception.

But suppose we accept Prichard's claim that ``the faculty of perception is that in virtue of which we apprehend the individual''. If visual awareness takes particulars as objects, it is not a form of propositional knowledge. But that does not mean that vision, so conceived, lacks epistemic significance. Vision can be a source of knowledge insofar as the perceiver can recognize the object of perception for what it is. When I look at the ripening tomato, the tomato is present in my awareness of it. Moreover, if I possess the appropriate recognitional capacities, in being so aware of the ripening tomato, I can come to know various things about it---that it is yellowish red, say. The non-propositional sensory mode of awareness involved in visual perception may not be a form of knowledge, but it makes me \emph{knowledgeable} of its object. Sensory awareness makes the subject knowledgeable of its object in the sense that it makes knowledge about its object \emph{available} to the perceiving subject. Vision makes the subject knowledgeable of its object even if, in the circumstances of perception, the subject lacks the conceptual capacities for knowing some range of propositions. Suppose the subject subsequently acquires the relevant conceptual capacities, in recalling the object of sight, the subject may recognize what they had seen and thus acquire propositional knowledge. So even if in the circumstances of perception the subject lacks the relevant conceptual capacities for knowing some proposition, vision can make knowledge of that proposition available. Perception constitutes a change in the subject's knowledge potential whether or not such knowledge is in fact activated (in Williamson's \citeyear{Williamson:1990uq} terminology).

In looking at the ripening tomato by my window, I see the yellowish red of the tomato. If I recognize what I thus see, I can come to know that the tomato is yellowish red. What I know is a proposition---that the tomato is yellowish red. What I see is a particular---the yellowish red of the tomato. How can awareness of that particular make available knowledge of that proposition? The objects of sensory awareness are epistemically significant because of an alethic connection between them and potentially known propositions. The yellowish red of the tomato is a \emph{truthmaker} of the proposition that the tomato is yellowish red \citep[see][]{Johnston:2006uq}. It is impossible for the yellowish red of the tomato to exist and the proposition that the tomato is yellowish red to be false. More generally:
\begin{quote}
	If a particular, \( x \)---be it an object, event, or property instance---is a truthmaker for a proposition, \( p \), then it is necessary that if \( x \) exists, then \( p \) is true. 
\end{quote}
What is the nature of the modality involved in this claim? I am tempted to say that it is logical necessity, though, of course, a sense of logical necessity distinct from model-theoretic definitions associated with formal systems  \citep[for doubts about model-theoretic definitions of logical necessity see][]{Etchemendy:1988et,Etchemendy:1988sa}. Nevertheless, the relevant modality deserves to be described as logical necessity, at least in a broader sense, since the source of the necessity flows from the nature of truth. (It is partly for this reason that I doubt that this could be the basis of a modal analysis of truthmaking.) Visual awareness is epistemically significant insofar as its object is the truthmaker of potentially known propositions. Vision makes me knowledgeable of particulars arrayed in a mind-independent environment by making me aware of sensible truthmakers.

% The yellowish red of the tomato exist; so, necessarily, the proposition that the tomato is yellowish red is true. 

A residual doubt may remain. Sellars famously connects knowledge and reasons in the following fashion:
\begin{quote}
	The essential point is that in characterizing an episode or state as that of \emph{knowing}, we are not giving an empirical description of that episode or state; we are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify what one says. \citep[§36]{Sellars:1956xp}
\end{quote}
Sellars undertakes a number of separable commitments in this passage, but suppose at least this much---that we can only know what we have reason to judge. It is natural to think that vision is a potential source of knowledge only insofar as it makes the subject aware of what reasons there are. But now suppose further that reasons must have a propositional structure---either by being, or being individuated by, true propositions, or by being states or events with true propositional contents \citep[see][141, 143--4]{McDowell:1996uq}. Insofar as visual awareness takes particulars as its objects it lacks a propositional structure. But this would preclude it from the space of reasons. Seeing the tomato, at least as presently conceived, could not be an awareness of what reasons there are and so could not be a potential source of knowledge.

Not all philosophers accept that knowledge requires the possession of reasons \citep[see][]{Pryor:2007fk}. But even granting that knowledge involves reasons, the argument can be resisted insofar as it involves a substantive and controversial claim about the metaphysics of reasons---that reasons must have a propositional structure. Against this, let me dogmatically assert my adherence to a radically externalist conception of reasons \citep[see][]{Scanlon:1998hb,Raz:2000tm}. On this conception, the yellowish red of the tomato is a reason for thinking that the tomato is not quite ripe. Note well, it is the yellowish red of the tomato, and not my seeing that the tomato is yellowish red, or my believing that the tomato is yellowish red, which is a reason. The yellowish red of the tomato lacks a propositional structure---it is a particular, a property instance. It is spatially distant from me---the yellowish red inheres in the opaque surface of the tomato a meter away and inherits its location from the surface in which it inheres. It is an aspect of how things are independently of me. The yellowish red of the tomato is a reason that warrants judging that the tomato is yellowish red. Indeed, in this instance, there could be no better reason---the yellowish red of the tomato warrants judging that the tomato is red because the former makes the true latter. Of course, not all reasons are of this form. The yellowish red of the tomato is also a reason, in certain circumstances, for thinking that the tomato is unripe, but the yellowish red of the tomato doesn't make it true that the tomato is unripe; at best, it is sign or symptom of the fruit's relative maturity. From this perspective, Davidson's \citeyearpar[310]{Davidson:1986uq} claim that ``nothing can count as a reason for holding a belief except another belief'' is an unwarranted form of psychologism (in something like Travis' \citeyear{Travis:2006fk} sense). Of course, in order for the yellowish red of the tomato to rationally bear on what I am to think, it must be cognitively accessible. But that is what perception does for me---perception makes me aware of what reasons there are. Perception is thus a mode of reasonableness (in Scanlon's \citeyear[]{Scanlon:1998hb} sense). I do not mean to resolve this disagreement, but merely to register it. It is one of the issues at the heart of the dispute about the nature and existence of the Given (for discussion see Ayers \citeyear{Ayers:2004kx} and McDowell \citeyear{McDowell:2006vn}).

Vision affords awareness of spatially distant particulars. % This distinctive sensory mode of awareness is non-proposition\-al---\-it doesn't take a fact as its object, but a particular. % This sensory mode of awareness of spatiotemporal particulars arrayed in a mind-independent environment makes one knowledgeable of that environment. In being so aware of a particular, the perceiver is in a position to know certain things about it, depending, of course, on the perceiver's possession and exercise of recognitional capacities appropriate to the given circumstances. Sensory awareness makes propositional knowledge available to the perceiving subject whether or not such knowledge is in fact activated. 
In being so aware of a particular, the subject is in a position to know certain things about it, depending, of course, on their possession and exercise of recognitional capacities appropriate to the given circumstances. Being thus knowledgeable of a particular endows the subject with a kind of authority. This authority is a power---the subject can possess this authority without exercising it. If in seeing the yellowish red of the tomato I am knowledgeable of that particular, then I am warranted in judging that the tomato is yellowish red whether or not I so judge. But if I do, then, at least in propitious circumstances, I thereby come to know that the tomato is yellowish red. The warrant, here, should be understood as an entitlement to judge. It needn't be conceived as a factor into which knowledge might be analyzed. Moreover, it is an \emph{epistemic} entitlement: The object of my awareness, the yellowish red of the tomato, is a reason that warrants, in the given circumstance, my judging that the tomato is yellowish red where so judging is \emph{coming to know}. Vision confers this epistemic entitlement given the alethic connection between the particular that is the object of visual awareness and the proposition potentially known. Awareness of the sensible truthmaker of a proposition affords the subject with a reason that is in this way akin to proof---it is logically impossible for the particular to exist and the proposition to be false \citep[see][]{Cook-Wilson:1926sf,Kalderon:2010fk}. Because in seeing the yellowish red of the tomato I possess a reason that would, in the given circumstance, warrant my coming to know that the tomato is yellowish red, I am authoritative about the yellowish red of the tomato. My seeing the yellowish red of the tomato can stand proxy for any inquiry on your part about the color of the tomato. If in coming to know that the tomato is yellowish red, I express my knowledge by stating it, I extend to you an offer to take it on my authority that the tomato is the color that I see it to be.

\section{Sellars and McDowell on Perceptual Experience} % (fold)
\label{sec:mcdowell_on_sellars_on_perception}

In claiming that vision is a sensory mode of awareness of the mind-independent environment, I am, thus far at least, in agreement with Sellars. Sellars however insists that vision is a mode of \emph{propositional} awareness that is, or constitutes, knowledge of its propositional object. In part, this is a disagreement about what it takes for perceptual judgements to be authoritative in the sense outlined above. % Sellars insists that authority requires knowledge, not knowledgeableness.  % Indeed Sellars doubts whether non-propositional awareness even makes sense:
% \begin{quote}
%     [I]n ordinary usage, [there is] a sense of \emph{know} in which it is followed by a noun or descripive phrase which refers to a particular, thus:
%     \begin{quote}
%         Do you know John?\\
%         Do you know the President?
%     \end{quote}
%     Because these questions are equivalent to ``Are you acquainted with John?'' and ``Are you acquainted with the President?'' the phrase ``knowledge by acquaintance'' recommends itslef as a useful metaphor for this stipulated sense of \emph{know} and, like other useful metaphors, has congealed into a technical term. \citep[§4]{Sellars:1956xp}
% \end{quote}
% Sellars is wrong about ordinary usage here. According to the OED, the earliest forms of ``knowledge'' take the sense of \emph{acknowledgement} or \emph{recognition}, and neither sense requires a propositional complement. And carnal knowledge would not be \emph{carnal} if it were \emph{propositional}. Such considerations are inconclusive. More telling is whether Sellars' account of visual awareness can withstand critical scrutiny.

According to Sellars, visual awareness is a form of propositional awareness attributed to perceivers by statements involving ``seeing that''. Seeing that something is some way involves four separable elements.

First, seeing that something is some way involves a reliable differential responsiveness to objects, events, and features of the mind-independent environment or facts about these. This reliable differential responsiveness is a necessary if not a sufficient condition for perceptual awareness. If an allergen reliably causes insensible physiological changes, then one would be reliably responding to the presence of the allergen without being aware that the allergen is present. This reliable differential responsiveness is a species of sensitivity, more generally. In \emph{Science and Metaphyscs}, \citet[4]{Sellars:1967uq} describes it as ``sheer receptivity''.

Second, seeing that something is some way involves undergoing an experience understood as an ``inner episode''. From within, this inner episode may be just like an inner episode that is not itself a component of perceptual awareness:
    \begin{quote}
        [I]t is clear that two experiences may be identical \emph{as experiences}, and yet one be properly referred to as \emph{seeing that} something is green, and the other \emph{merely} as a case of something's \emph{looking} green. \citep[§16]{Sellars:1956xp}
    \end{quote}
    So the occurrence of the inner episode is a necessary if not a sufficient condition for perceptual awareness. A large part of ``Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' is devoted to understanding how, and to what extent, these inner episodes could be consistent with the psychological nominalism that Sellars admires.

Third, seeing that something is some way involves undergoing an experience that ``contains a propositional claim'':
    \begin{quote}
        I realize that by speaking of experiences as containing propositional claims, I may be knocking at closed doors. I ask the reader to bear with me, however, as the justification of this way of talking is one of my major aims. If I am permitted to issue this verbal currency now, I hope to put it on the gold standard before concluding the argument. \citep[§15]{Sellars:1956xp}
    \end{quote}
    Sellars may have been knocking on closed doors in 1956, but the thought that perceptual experience has a propositional, or at least an intentional, content is now the prevailing orthodoxy. However, we should not anachronistically assume that Sellars understands the ascription of propositional claims to experience in the same way that \citet[]{Harman:1990lm} or \citet[]{Tye:2000vn} would. Specifically, Sellars' attribution of propositional claims to experience must be understood in a manner consistent with his sympathies for psychological nominalism. Most contemporary intentionalists share no such sympathies. Not all modes of sensory experience contain propositional claims---feeling a stabbing pain in one's shoulder is a sensory experience but it contains no propositional claim, even by Sellars' lights. But visual perception, if it is to be a mode or source of knowledge of the distal environment, contains a propositional claim about that environment. Again, this is a necessary if not a sufficient condition. According to Sellars, the experience of something merely looking some way contains a propositional claim---that the thing is that way---but is not a mode of perceptual awareness.

Fourth, what distinguishes seeing that something is some way and it merely looking that way is the subject's endorsement of the propositional claim contained in their experience. Jones in seeing that the necktie is green endorses the propositional claim, contained in his experience, that the necktie is green. If, on the other hand, the necktie merely looks green to Jones, endorsement is withheld from that claim. If seeing-that is a form of knowing-that, the element of endorsement is intelligible. In knowing that the necktie is green, Jones is, in an important sense, authoritative about the greenness of the necktie. Jones' endorsement of the claim, in claiming to see that the necktie is green, extends to his audience the offer to take it on his authority that the necktie is green. Look ascriptions differ precisely in this element. While the propositional claim that the necktie is green may be introduced into the conversation by the look statement, the speaker thereby withholds endorsement of that claim. The endorsement of the propositional claims contained in experience is central to Sellars account of perceptual awareness. It is this feature that brings perception into the space of reasons (though, importantly, not in a way that accommodates classical foundationalism). % \citet[§§16--17]{Sellars:1956xp} introduces the element of endorsement by way of a contrast with something merely looking some way which involves withholding endorsement of the propositional claim contained in experience. However, there are reasons to doubt that the contrast has been adequately made out.
% 
% First, not all look statement introduce the relevant proposition into the conversation. Since no relevant proposition is introduced, the speaker is not withhold endorsement from any such proposition, nor is any such proposition contained in the corresponding experience. 
% 
% Sellars' discussion is focused on relativized look statements, statements of the form:
% \begin{quote}
%     The necktie looks green to Jones
% \end{quote}
% In understanding relativized look statements to involve the ascription of propositional claims to experience, Sellars is committed to the occurrence of ``green'' embedded in the look ascription having a certain semantic function---it modifies the subject of the look ascription, the necktie. It is in virtue of this semantic function that the proposition that the necktie is green can be derived from the relativized look ascription and introduced as a topic of conversation. 
% 
% I suspect that Sellars is motivated to assign this semantic function to the embedded color adjective because of the ``fundamental point that'':
% \begin{quote}
%     [T]he sense of ``red'' in which things \emph{look} red is, on the face of it, the same as that in which things \emph{are} red. \citep[§12]{Sellars:1956xp}
% \end{quote} 
% Call this the \emph{univocity thesis}. According to the univocity thesis, an adjective predicated of a material object has the same meaning when embedded in looks or appearance attributions. This observation imposes an important constraint on the analysis of looks or appearances. Consider an analysis of looks in terms of sense data. Something looking red would involve the subject being aware of a red sense datum. If red is a way for material objects to be, then the sense in which sense data are ``red'' would be different from the sense in which material objects are. But this would violate the univocity constraint. % Compare Frege's claim in ``The Thought'': 
% % \begin{quote}
% %     The word `red', if it does not indicate a property of things, but is meant to indicate marks of sense-impressions which are part of my consciousness, is applicable only in the domain of my consciousness. \citet[67]{Frege:1918lq}
% % \end{quote}
% 
% However, not all look statements introduce a propositional claim into the conversation. Sometimes embedded occurrences of ``red'' function semantically to modify not the subject of the looks statement, but the verbal head, ``looks''. Thus according to \citet[]{Chisholm:1957dq}, on the comparative use of a look statement, ``red'' modifies ``looks'' by specifying a way of looking; it does so indirectly by means of a comparison with the look of green things in some other conversationally salient context. Moreover, the existence of the comparative use is consistent with the univocity thesis. That embedded and freestanding occurrences of ``red'' share the same meaning is consistent with them functioning differently in different linguistic contexts. The following occurrences of ``Frege'' mean the same even though they differ in semantic function: 
% \begin{quote}
%   Frege wrote the \emph{Begriffsschrift}.\\
%   Joan Weiner is a Frege scholar. 
% \end{quote}
% In the latter occurrence, ``Frege'' functions to modify a noun in a way that the former occurrence does not. Moreover it is not to be understood as a homonymic adjective. The adjective is ``Fregean'' not ``Frege'', and a Fregean scholar need not be a Frege scholar. A Fregean scholar might be a philosopher of language pursuing, in a novel way, Frege's program, or they might be an under-appreciated logician harboring racist sentiments, and none of these ways of being requires contributing to Frege scholarship in the way that being a Frege scholar does. So the univocity thesis lends no support to the claim that ``red'' embedded in look ascriptions functions semantically to modify the subject of that ascription.
% 
% There is something to Sellars thought that, at least over a wide range of cases, the assertion of a relativized looks-ascription withholds assent from the corresponding propositional claim. But is it ``looks'' that is responsible for this pragmatic effect or is it the relativizing clause? If it is the relativizing clause that is responsible for the pragmatic effect, where it is present, and not ``looks'', then ``looks'' is not a force operator.
% 
% Relativized look ascriptions do not invariably withhold assent from the corresponding propositional claim. Look statements are subject to a certain kind of context sensitivity. Depending on the practical interests of the conversational participants, a statement of the form:
%     \begin{quote}
%         \( x \) looks \( F \) to \( S \)
%     \end{quote}
%     may be a claim about how \( x \) is (\( x \) is such that it looks \( F \) to \( S \)), but it may equally be a claim about how \( S \) is (\( S \) is such that \( x \) looks \( F \), as opposed to \( G \), or not at all). Focus on a case where the conversational interest lies with the state of the perceiving subject. In a conversational context where it is mutually known that the tomato is red, there may yet remain a point in saying that the tomato looks red if that's a report about how things are with the perceiver. But in reporting how things are with you (things are such that the tomato looks red to you), you are not withholding endorsement of what's mutually known---that the tomato is red.

These four separable elements combine in perceptual awareness in roughly the following manner. In seeing that the necktie is green, Jones undergoes a visual experience that is indiscriminable upon reflection from an experience he might have undergone if the necktie merely looked green to him. This experience is a reliable differential response to the greenness of the necktie. The experience contains a propositional claim, that the necktie is green, and its having that content is ultimately explained in terms of the way in which inner episodes are modeled on overt linguistic actions. In seeing that the necktie is green, not only does Jones reliable respond to the greenness of the necktie by undergoing an experience that contains the propositional claim that the necktie is green, but he adopts a normative posture or stance towards that claim---specifically, he endorses that claim. In seeing that the necktie is green, the question, ``Which color is the necktie?'', is \emph{closed} for Jones---there is no reason for Jones to inquire further about the color of the necktie even if he is interested in determining its color.

What is the role of reliable differential responsiveness in Sellars account of perceptual awareness? Is Sellars merely emphasizing that perceptual awareness is itself a mode of sensitivity? Or is perceptual awareness to be analyzed or otherwise explained partly in terms of sensitivity? 

On the latter alternative, reliable differential responsiveness must be conceived in a certain way, if perceptual awareness is to be analyzed or otherwise explained in terms of it. Specifically, it must be reductively understood---the reliable differential responsiveness to objects, events, and features of the mind-independent environment, or facts about these, must be individuated independently of the subject's perceptual awareness of them. Suppose that this reliable differential responsiveness is a necessary if not sufficient condition for perceptual awareness that can be conjoined with other conditions that are not only jointly sufficient for perceptual awareness but constitute an \emph{analysis} of perceptual awareness. Then, on pain of circularity, the reliable differential responsiveness must be specified independently of the subject's perceptual awareness. 

It is not merely an \emph{analytical} role that would require that reliable differential responsiveness be individuated independently of perceptual awareness; an \emph{explanatory} role would require this as well. If reliable differential responsiveness is partly explanatory of what makes a state or episode a mode of perceptual awareness, then it must be individuated independently of the state or episode being a mode of perceptual awareness. Contrast this with a non-reductive conception of perceptual sensitivity. If perceptual sensitivity is, or is constituted by, perceptual awareness, then perceptual awareness could not be explained, even in part, in terms of perceptual sensitivity. On this conception, perceptual awareness is a mode of sensitivity, but perceptual awareness is not analyzable or otherwise explained in terms of sensitivity reductively understood. 

In \emph{Science and Metaphysics}, Sellars recasts and refines his account of perceptual awareness in explicitly Kantian terms. In so doing, he provides further information about the relation between reliable differential responsiveness and perceptual awareness. Sellars describes the reliable differential responsiveness as ``sheer receptivity'' understood as the passive operation of sensibility in contrast with the active operation of understanding.


% Consider another experimental subject of Frankfurt's Dr Black. A device is surgically implanted that will cut off the flow of information from the optic nerve if a predefined target is not confined to some region of the visual field. Should the target exit that region---by the target moving with respect to the perceiver, or the perceiver moving with respect to the target, without corresponding adjustments---then the optic nerve will be temporarily disabled, for thirty seconds, say. (The disabling requires energy which means the implant fails safely---a designer feature Dr Black takes perverse pride in.) After the device is implanted, the subject recovers from surgery with the target within the region. Small changes in the circumstances of perception---the target moving slightly, or the subject's gaze moving slightly---would result in temporary blindness. But that is consistent with the subject seing the target upon regaining consciousness.
